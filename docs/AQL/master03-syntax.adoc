= AQL Syntax Description

== Overview

AQL has five clauses: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `TIMEWINDOW`. The `SELECT` clause specifies the data elements to be returned. The `FROM` clause specifies the result source and the corresponding containment criteria. The `WHERE` clause specifies data value criteria within the result source. The `ORDER BY` clause indicates the data items used to order the returned result set. `TIMEWINDOW` clause is to constrain the query to data that was available in the system within the specified time criteria.

In AQL, openEHR path syntax is used to locate any node or data values defined within archetypes. In the `SELECT` clause, the openEHR path syntax can be used to indicate expected objects or data values to be returned (similarly to how SQL 'projections' work). The `FROM` clause uses containment mechanisms indicating the scope of the query data source. `WHERE` clause uses archetype path to set query criteria on archetypes or any node within the archetypes. The following sections introduce the AQL syntax in detail.

NOTE: If no `ORDER BY` clause is specified, then the query result doesn't have any default ordering criteria defined by this specification. Ordering could be defined by each implementation or be random. In terms of compliance to this specification, default ordering in results is undefined.

== Reserved words and characters

Keywords in AQL are not case sensitive, so `SELECT`, `Select`, `select`, `SeLeCt`, etc. are processed in the same way. AQL has the following reserved keywords and characters:

* `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `TIMEWINDOW`
* `TOP`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `CONTAINS`
* `max`, `now`, `current-date`, `current-date-time`
* `matches`, `in`, `exists`, `not in`
* `"` and `'`: double and single quote characters are used to delimit string values;
* `|`: bar characters are used to delimit intervals;
* `[]`: brackets are used to delimit coded terms, archetype id values or openEHR reference model class attribute values.
* `{}`: brackets are used with `matches` delimiting matches criteria
* `<`, `>`, `=`, `%`, `!`, `$`

== openEHR path syntax

The openEHR path syntax has been described in detail (see the {openehr_overview}[Architecture Overview specification]). AQL utilises the basic openEHR path syntax to reference both coarse-grainedand fine-grained archetype nodes (objects and data values, respectively), and openEHR class instances and attributes, when referencing something that is not defined in an archetype but is part of the openEHR Reference Model. A set of openEHR path examples are provided on this section.

=== openEHR path examples - archetype path

An archetype path is the path referring to any node within an archetype. The following is an ADL workbench screen shot of apgar observation node map. The table below shows some examples.

[width="100%",cols="1,1,1,1,1",options="header",]
|===
|Archetype RM type |Archetype node name |Archetype ID                               |Path syntax  | Referenced RM Type

|`OBSERVATION`     |Apgar score         |openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.apgar.v1           |`/`  | `OBSERVATION`
|`OBSERVATION`     |Heart rate          |openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.pulse.v1           |`/data[at0002]/events[at0003]/data[at0001]/items[at0004]`  | `ELEMENT`
|`OBSERVATION`     |Systolic            |openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.blood_pressure.v2  |`/data[at0001]/events[at0006]/data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value`  | `DV_QUANTITY`
|===

=== openEHR path examples - path to RM class attributes

Another type of openEHR path is the path pointing to an attribute of openEHR Reference Model classes. The examples shown below uses the attributes from the `COMPOSITION` class.

|`COMPOSITION.context.start_time`   |`/context/start_time`
|`COMPOSITION.uid.value`            |`/uid/value`
|===

== AQL variables

AQL variables are used to refer a specific openEHR class defined within an AQL `FROM` clause. Consider this example:

--------
SELECT
   o/data[at0001]/events[at0006]/data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/magnitude,
   o/data[at0001]/events[at0006]/data[at0003]/items[at0005]/value/magnitude
FROM
   EHR [ehr_id/value='1234']
      CONTAINS COMPOSITION [openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.encounter.v1]
         CONTAINS OBSERVATION o [openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.blood_pressure.v1]
WHERE
   o/data[at0001]/events[at0006]/data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/magnitude >= 140 OR
   o/data[at0001]/events[at0006]/data[at0003]/items[at0005]/value/magnitude >= 90
--------

This AQL example defines only one AQL variables: `o` that represents OBSERVATIONs that comply with the `openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.blood_pressure.v1` archetype.


AQL variables have the following features:

* AQL variable names must be defined in an AQL `FROM` clause.
* A variable name must be unique within an AQL statement.
* Not all classes defined within the `FROM` clause need a variable name. It is required only when other clauses within other AQL clauses need to refer to the class defined in the `FROM` clause. For instance, the example doesn't define a variable name for EHR or COMPOSITION classes. Variable name `o` is used by both `WHERE` clause and `SELECT` clause, as root object of the following paths.
* Variable names are used by other clauses within the AQL statement along with openEHR path to form a complete AQL path - Identified path. Refer back to Section 2.2. example, `o/data[at0001/events[at0006]/data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/value]` points to the systolic value node of the Observation archetype `openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.blood_pressure.v1`.
* Except for the reserved words, any characters, whitespace, letters, Alphanumeric, and underscore can be used for a variable name. Variable names are not case sensitive. Digits are not recommended at the beginning of a variable name even though there is no formal restriction.

== Parameters

AQL syntax supports parameterisation. AQL parameters are used to indicate criteria, which will be substituted with values at run time. Supporting parameterisation is one of the mechanisms used to realise sharing AQL statements within a system or across system boundaries.

The parameters can be EHR specific (such as the parameter of EHR identifier or EHR creation date time), archetype specific (such as an archetype identifier, or archetype constraints), or template specific (such as a template identifier or template constraints).

=== Parameter syntax

A parameter always starts with a dollar sign `$` followed by the parameter name, e.g. `$ehrUid`. The parameter name can consist of letters, digits and underscores. It cannot have spaces and it cannot be an AQL reserved word.

A parameter can be used for any criteria values within an AQL statement, e.g.:

* within a predicate: `[$archetypeId]`, `[at0003, $nameValue]`, `[ehr_id/value=$ehrId]`
* withing a WHERE criteria: `o/data[at0001]/events[at0006]/data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/value > $systolicCriteria`

NOTE: In the WHERE criteria, when the value of the parameter is not a number or boolean value, it should be substituted with the correspondent quotes added to the value, for instance `o/../.. = $textVariable`, when substituted should look like this `o/../.. = "value"` (single or double quotes could be used).

=== When parameters are needed

Parameters are needed when the same AQL query statement is used with different criteria values. This AQL example is to return all abnormal blood pressure values for a single specific EHR. This query has a parameter `$ehrUid`. This parameter will be substituted by a specific `EHR.ehr_id` value at run time. Consequently, this query can be reused for all EHRs either within an EHR system or by other EHR systems (assuming these EHR systems support AQL).

=== Where and how parameters are resolved

AQL query parameters can be resolved at application level, or EHR system level. It depends on what the query parameters are used for and the design/implementation of the system or components. Query parameters would be normally resolved outside of a query engine.

If a query needs to be reusable across different EHR systems, any query parameters normally need to be registered in these EHR systems so that they can be resolved with real values from each environment. A typical example of this type of query parameter is `$ehrUid`. If the query is only used within an application, then the query parameters would be resolved by the application, such as the parameter of healthcare facility identifier or template identifier.

There are no specific guidelines on how to resolve query parameters. Generally speaking, a parameter name is used as a key (or a key is associated with a parameter name) and the key needs to be unique within the boundary where the parameters are resolved. The EHR system or application needs to have the API functions to get the real value with a given parameter name or key.


== Predicates

AQL has three types of predicates: the standard predicate, the archetype predicate, and the node predicate.

=== Standard predicate

Standard predicates always have a left operand, operator and right operand, e.g. `[ehr_id/value='123456']`.

* The left operand is normally an openEHR path, such as `ehr_id/value`, `name/value`.
* The right operand is normally a criterion value or a parameter, such as `'123456'`, `$ehrUid`. It can also be an openEHR path (based on the BNF).
* The operator can be one of the following:
+
----
>, >=, =, <, <=, !=
----

=== Archetype predicate

An archetype predicate is a shortcut of a standard predicate, i.e. the predicate does not have the left operand and operator. It only has an archetype id, e.g. `[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.encounter.v1]`. The archetype predicate is a specific type of query criterion indicating what archetype instances are relevant to this query. It is used to scope the the data source from which the query expected data is to be retrieved. Therefore, an archetype predicate is only used within an AQL `FROM` clause, for example,

--------
FROM EHR [ehr_id/value='1234']
   CONTAINS COMPOSITION c [openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.encounter.v1]
      CONTAINS OBSERVATION o [openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.blood_pressure.v1]
--------

This predicates could also be written as `Standard predicates`:

--------
FROM EHR e
   CONTAINS COMPOSITION c
      CONTAINS OBSERVATION o
WHERE
   e/ehr_id/value = '1234' AND
   c/archetype_node_id = 'openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.encounter.v1' AND
   o/archetype_node_id = 'openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.blood_pressure.v1'
--------

This equivalence could be used by implementers of AQL to transform predicates into their standard form, as a canonical representation of the query, which can simplified its processing, validation, evaluation and transformation into specific database query languages.

=== Node predicate

A node predicate is also a shortcut of a standard predicate. It has the following forms:

* Containing an `archetype_node_id` (i.e. an at-code) only, e.g.:
+
--------
[at0002]
--------
+
The correspondent standard predicate would be:
+
--------
[archetype_node_id=at0002]
--------


* Containing an `archetype_node_id` and a `name value/criterion`, e.g.:
+
--------
[at0002 and name/value=$nameValue]
[at0002 and name/value='real name value']
--------
+
The correspondent standard predicates would be:
+
--------
[archetype_node_id=at0002 and name/value=$nameValue]
[archetype_node_id=at0002 and name/value='real name value']
--------

* Containing an `archetype_node_id` and a shortcut of a `name/value` criterion, e.g.:
+
--------
[at0002, $nameValue]
[at0002, 'real name value']
--------
+
The correspondent standard predicates would be:
+
--------
[archetype_node_id=at0002 and name/value=$nameValue]
[archetype_node_id=at0002 and name/value='real name value']
--------

* The above three forms are the most common node predicates. A more advanced form is to include a general criterion instead of the `name/value` criterion within the predicate. The general criterion consists of left operand, operator, and right operand, e.g.:
+
--------
[at0002 and value/defining_code/terminology_id/value=$terminologyId]
--------

A node predicate defines criteria on fine-grained data. It is only used within an identified path.

== Operators

=== Comparison operators

The table below shows the supported AQL comparison operators, meaning and example.

[width="100%",cols="1,2,5",options="header",]
|===
|Operator   |Meaning                    |Example

|=          |Equal                      |`name/value = $nameValue`
|>          |Greater than               |`o/data[at0001]/.../data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/value >140`
|>=         |Greater than or equal to   |`o/data[at0001]/..../data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/value >=140`
|<          |Smaller than               |`o/data[at0001]/.../data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/value <160`
|\<=        |Smaller than or equal to   |`o/data[at0001]/.../data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/value <=160`
|!=         |not equals to              |`c/archetype_details/template_id/value != ''`
|matches    |advanced matcher           |`o/data[at0002]/.../name/defining_code/code_string matches {'18919-1', '18961-3', '19000-9'}`
|===


=== matches operator definition

The matches operator is used in the `WHERE` clause. This operator needs left operand and right operand. Left operand is an AQL identified path. Right operand is enclosed within curly braces. Right operand of matches operator has three forms:

. type of constraint ADL (cADL): this type of right operand can be a value list or a value range. Value range is not supported in the current AQL grammar. Below is an example with matches a string value list:
+
--------
SELECT
   o/data[at0002]/events[at0003]/data/items[at0015]/items[at0018]/name
FROM
   EHR [uid=$ehrUid]
      CONTAINS Composition c
         CONTAINS Observation o[openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.microbiology.v1]
WHERE
   o/data[at0002]/events[at0003]/data/items[at0015]/items[at0018]/items[at0019]/items[at0021]/name/defining_code/code_string matches {'18919-1', '18961-3', '19000-9'}
--------

. URI: can be a terminology URI, openEHR EHR URI, or other URI. An example with a terminology URI is shown below:
+
--------
SELECT
   e/ehr_status/subject/external_ref/id/value, diagnosis/data/items[at0002.1]/value
FROM
   EHR e
      CONTAINS Composition c[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.problem_list.v1]
         CONTAINS Evaluation diagnosis[openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.problem-diagnosis.v1]
WHERE
   c/name/value='Current Problems' AND
   diagnosis/data/items[at0002.1]/value/defining_code matches { terminology://Snomed-CT/hierarchy?rootConceptId=50043002 }
--------


=== Logical operators

==== AND

`AND` is a binary boolean operator used to link two boolean expressions. It evaluates to `true` when both operands evaluate to `true`, and it evaluates to `false` otherwise.

==== OR

`OR` is a binary boolean operator used to link two boolean expressions. It evaluates to `true` when any of the operands evaluate to `true`, and it evaluates to `false` otherwise.

==== NOT

`NOT` is a unary Boolean operator and it is always followed by either a single identified expression or boolean identified expression. It returns Boolean results: `true` means the followed expression (single or Boolean expression) is false.

The example below uses the `NOT` operator followed by a single identified expression:

--------
SELECT
   e/ehr_id/value
FROM
   EHR e
      CONTAINS COMPOSITION c[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.administrative_encounter.v1]
         CONTAINS ADMIN_ENTRY admission[openEHR-EHR-ADMIN_ENTRY.admission.v1]
WHERE
   NOT EXISTS c/content[openEHR-EHR-ADMIN_ENTRY.discharge.v1]
--------

The example below uses `NOT` operator followed by a boolean identified expression:

--------
SELECT
   e/ehr_id/value
FROM
   EHR e
      CONTAINS COMPOSITION c[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.administrative_encounter.v1]
         CONTAINS ADMIN_ENTRY admission[openEHR-EHR-ADMIN_ENTRY.admission.v1]
WHERE
   NOT (EXISTS c/content[openEHR-EHR-ADMIN_ENTRY.discharge.v1] AND
   e/ehr_status/subject/external_ref/namespace = 'CEC')
--------

The above example is equivalent to the two expressions shown below:

--------
SELECT
   e/ehr_id/value
FROM
   EHR e
      CONTAINS COMPOSITION c[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.administrative_encounter.v1]
         CONTAINS ADMIN_ENTRY admission[openEHR-EHR-ADMIN_ENTRY.admission.v1]
WHERE
   NOT EXISTS c/content[openEHR-EHR-ADMIN_ENTRY.discharge.v1] OR
   NOT e/ehr_status/subject/external_ref/namespace = 'CEC'


SELECT
   e/ehr_id/value
FROM
   EHR e
      CONTAINS COMPOSITION c[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.administrative_encounter.v1]
         CONTAINS ADMIN_ENTRY admission[openEHR-EHR-ADMIN_ENTRY.admission.v1]
WHERE
   NOT EXISTS c/content[openEHR-EHR-ADMIN_ENTRY.discharge.v1] OR
   e/ehr_status/subject/external_ref/namespace != 'CEC'
--------

These advanced operators are not yet supported by the grammar. The operator syntax is borrowed from ADL specifications. These are proposed to improve the richness and flexibility of AQL so that AQL syntax supports more complicated query scenarios.

==== EXISTS

`EXISTS` is a unary operator, which is always followed by a single operand. The single operand is an AQL identified path. This operator returns Boolean results: `true` means the data associated with the specified path exists, `false` otherwise. An `EXISTS` expression is a single identified expression. The latest grammar only allows this operator in `WHERE` clause. It may be required as part of openEHR path in future.

The example below means retrieving the identifiers of the EHRs which do not have discharge admin entry instance.

--------
SELECT
   e/ehr_id/value
FROM
   EHR e
      CONTAINS COMPOSITION c[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.administrative_encounter.v1]
         CONTAINS ADMIN_ENTRY admission[openEHR-EHR-ADMIN_ENTRY.admission.v1]
WHERE
   NOT EXISTS c/content[openEHR-EHR-ADMIN_ENTRY.discharge.v1]
--------

This example below means from a particular EHR, retrieving all composition uid values and the contained instruction instances if the instruction instances have links with particular EHR URI value.

--------
SELECT
   c/uid/value, instruction
FROM
   EHR e [ehr_id/value=$ehrid]
      CONTAINS COMPOSITION c
         CONTAINS INSTRUCTION instruction[openEHR-EHR-INSTRUCTION.referral.v1]
WHERE
   EXISTS instruction/links[target='ehr://327000002/87284370-2D4B-4e3d-A3F3-F303D2F4F34B@latest_trunk_version']
--------


== AQL identified paths

=== Usage

Identified paths are used to locate data items within an archetype RM class. Except for the `FROM` clause, an identified path could appears in any clauses of an AQL statement. For example, it can be used to indicate the data to be returned in a `SELECT` clause, or the data item on which query criteria are applied in a `WHERE` clause.

=== Syntax

AQL identified path can take any of the following forms:

* an AQL variable name defined within the `FROM` clause, followed by an openEHR path, e.g.
+
----
o/data[at0001]/.../data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/value
----

* an AQL variable name followed by a predicate, e.g.
+
----
o[name/value=$nameValue]
----

* an AQL variable name followed by a predicate and an openEHR path, e.g.
+
----
o[name/value=$nameValue]/data[at0001]/.../data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/value
----

== Leaf Data

=== Primitive Types

==== String Data

All strings are enclosed in double quotes or single quotes. Line breaks are not supported.

==== Integer data

Integers are represented as numberic literals, such as `1`, `2`, `365`. Commas or periods for breaking long numbers are not allowed. Hex integers are not supported.

==== Real data

Real numbers are the decimal literals that include a decimal point, such as `3.1415926`. Commas or periods for breaking long numbers are not allowed.

==== Boolean data

Boolean values are indicated using the case-insensitive literals `true` or `false`.

==== Dates and Times

No matter whether the date/date time is complete or partial, it is allowed in AQL as long as it is in {iso_8601}[ISO 8601 date/date time format]. Quotes (either single quotes or double quotes) are required to enclose the date/date time value. In AQL grammar, it is treated as a date value if the value is a complete calendar date represented in ISO 8601 extended format and if single quotes are used. If the value is in other ISO 8601 date/date time format, AQL treats it as a string value, but the AQL query engine processes it differently from a normal string value. It is a temporary solution. In future, a date/date time value should be identified as date/date time value if it is a valid ISO 8601 date/date time. Examples are as below:

--------
WHERE composition/context/start_time > '19860101' // a complete date. AQL grammar identifies it as a string value.
WHERE composition/context/start_time < "120000+0930"  // ISO 8601 time. AQL grammar identifies it as a string value.
WHERE composition/context/start_time <= '1986-01-01'  // complete calendar date in ISO 8601 extended format. AQL grammar identifies this value as a date value.
--------

=== Other Built-in Types

==== URI

URI leaf data is enclosed within curly braces after `matches` operator. URI can be expressed as a normal URI described in {rfc3986}[IETF RFC 3986]. URIs are not case sensitive. In AQL, a URI can be either terminology URI or an EHR URI.

==== Terminology URI

A terminology URI consists of the following components:

. *terminology*: the URI schemes value;
. *terminology service*: the URI authority value, such as SNOMED-CT;
. *terminology function name*: the URI path, e.g. "hierarchy" is the function name in the example shown below;
. *argument values* required by the terminology functions - URI queries;

This is an example of a terminology URI:

----
    terminology://snomed-CT/hierarchy?rootConceptId=50043002
    \_________/   \_______/ \_______/ \___________/ \______/
        |             |         |           |__________|
     scheme       authority   path          | queries  |
        |             |         |           |          |
    terminology  terminology function    argument   argument
       uri         service                 name      value
----

==== Value List

Value list leaf data is enclosed within curly braces after matches operator. Each item is separated by comma if there are multiple items in the list. Value list can be string value list, date time value list, integer value list, and real value list. Quotes are required for string value list and date time value list.

A value list is only used in AQL` WHERE` clause when the criteria is to match one item of the list. The relationships among these value list items are "OR".

Some examples of value list:

--------
matches {'string item 1', 'string item 2', 'string item3'}  // a string list. It Equivalent to
                                                            // matches  string item1' or ..
                                                            // matches 'string item 2' or ..
                                                            // matches 'string item 3'
matches {'20060101', '20070101', '20080101'}                // a date value list
matches {1, 2, 3}                                           // a integer list
matches {1.1, 2.5, 3.8}                                     // a real value list
--------

==== Value Range

It is not supported in the current AQL grammar.

Value range leaf data is enclosed within curly braces after matches operator. It is only used in AQL `WHERE` clause to specify a criteria within a range. The syntax is similar to intervals of ordered primitive types detailed in Section 4.5.2, adl.pdf. Some examples:

----
matches {|3.0..5.0|} // means 3.0 <= x <=5.0
matches {|<8|}       // means x < 8
----

== Query structure

=== Overview

AQL structure has been briefly introduced in Section 2.2. This section describes the syntax in more formal detail.

AQL structure has the following clauses and these clauses must be listed in the same order as the list below in an AQL statement. An AQL statement must contain `SELECT` and `FROM` clauses.

* `SELECT` (mandatory)
* `FROM` (mandatory)
* `WHERE` (optional)
* `ORDER BY` (optional)
* `TIMEWINDOW` (optional)

=== FROM

The `FROM` clause utilises class expressions and a set of containment criteria to specify the data source from which the query required data is to be retrieved.  Its function is similar as the `FROM` clause of an SQL expression.

==== FROM Syntax

A simple `FROM` clause consists of three parts: keyword `FROM`, class expression and/or containment constraints, e.g.

--------
FROM
   EHR e [ehr_id/value=$ehrId]
       CONTAINS COMPOSITION c[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.report.v1]
--------

==== Class expressions

Two examples of a class expression are shown below:

--------
EHR e [ehr_id/value=$ehrId]                        -- EHR class, class identifier/variable, and a standard predicate
COMPOSITION c[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.report.v1]   -- COMPOSITION class, class identifier/variable, and an archetype predicate
--------

Class expressions are used for two purposes:

. indicating the constraints on RM classes so as to scope the data source for the query. For instance, `EHR e[ehr_id/value='123456']` indicates that the required data must be from a specific EHR with `ehr_id` value '123456'; while `COMPOSITION c[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.report.v1]` indicates the required data must be from or must be associated with a Composition instance with archetype id - `openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.report.v1`.
. defining a RM class variable that may be used by other clauses to indicate the required data or data items on which query criteria are applied. The example below uses the class expression to define a variable e which is used by the `SELECT` clause indicating all relevant ehr_id values are retrieved, and a variable c used by WHERE clause indicating that the query criteria is set on the composition template id value.
+
--------
SELECT
   e/ehr_id/value
FROM
   EHR e
      CONTAINS COMPOSITION c[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.referral.v1]
WHERE
   c/archetype_details/template_id/value = $templateId
--------

Class expressions syntax include three parts. A class expression must have part one and at least one of part two or part three.

. part one (mandatory): openEHR RM class name, such as `EHR`, `COMPOSITION`, `OBSERVATION` etc.
. part two (optional): AQL variable name
. part three (optional): a standard predicate or an archetype predicate.

==== Containment

Since archetypes are in hierarchical structure, AQL has a containment constraint which specifies the hierarchical relationships between parent and child data items. The `FROM` clause utilises this hierarchical constraint along with class expression to determine the data source to which the AQL query is applied.

The syntax of containment constraint is very simple: using keyword `CONTAINS` between two class expressions. Left class expression is the the parent object of the right class expression, e.g.

--------
EHR e CONTAINS COMPOSITION c [openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.referral.v1]
--------

Boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) and parentheses are used when multiple containment constrains are required, e.g.

--------
EHR e
   CONTAINS COMPOSITION c [openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.referral.v1] AND COMPOSITION c1 [openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.report.v1]

EHR e
   CONTAINS COMPOSITION c [openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.referral.v1]
      CONTAINS (OBSERVATION o [openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION-laboratory-hba1c.v1] AND OBSERVATION o1 [openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION-laboratory-glucose.v1])
--------

=== WHERE

An AQL `WHERE` clause is used to represent further criteria applied to the data items within the objects declared in the FROM clause. A `WHERE` clause expresses the query criteria that cannot be represented in other AQL clauses, such as criteria on archetype id, composition committal date time, and the criteria on in which order the returned results should be listed.

==== Syntax

The `WHERE` clause syntax has the following parts (in order): keyword `WHERE` and identified expression(s). Boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) and parenthesis can be used to represent multiple identified expressions. Examples:

--------
WHERE
   c/name/value=$nameValue AND c/archetype_details/template_id/value=$templateId
WHERE
   (c/name/value = $nameValue OR c/archetype_details/template_id/value = $templateId) AND
   o/data[at0001]/events[at0006]/data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/value >= 140
--------

==== Identified expression

Identified expression specifies the criteria within `WHERE` clause. It consists of left operand, operator and right operand.

. Left operand is normally an identified path,
. Operator is normally a comparison operator,
. Right operand is the criteria value, which normally is primitive type, such as String, Integer, Boolean, Double, or Float. When it is a string value, single quotation marks or double quotation marks are required. Right operand can also be a parameter or an identified path as well.

Examples:

* Left operand is an identified path and right operand is a real criteria value - primitive type:
+
--------
o/data[at0001]/events[at0006]/data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/value >= 140
c/archetype_details/template_id/value = 'health_encounter'
--------

* Left operand is an identified path and right operand is a parameter:
+
--------
c/archetype_details/template_id/value = $templateParameter
--------

* Both left operand and right operand are an identified path (this is an advanced feature):
+
--------
o/data[at0001]/events[at0006]/data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/value >
o1/data[at0001]/events[at0006]/data[at0003]/items[at0004]/value/value
--------

=== SELECT

A `SELECT` clause specifies what data is to be retrieved by the AQL query. The data can be any types from openEHR RM and any primitive data types. In addition, the `SELECT` clause uses `TOP` to indicate the number of result setS that should be returned and name alias to rename the retrieved data.

The `SELECT` syntax always starts with keyword `SELECT`, followed by `TOP` (optional), and identified path(s) or variable name(s) defined in the `FROM` clause. Each variable name or an identified path may have a name alias renaming the associated data.

If variable name(s) is(are) required, the full object of the type associated with the variable is retrieved, such as a `COMPOSITION`, an `OBSERVATION` object etc. If identified paths are required, the path-associated data items are returned. Multiple identifiers or identified paths are separated using a comma.

Some examples are shown below.

Example 1: retrieve all compositions' name value, context start time and composer name from a specific EHR.

--------
SELECT
   c/name/value AS Name, c/context/start_time AS date_time, c/composer/name AS Composer
FROM
   EHR e[ehr_id/value=$ehrUid] CONTAINS COMPOSITION c
--------

Example 2: Retrieve all composition objects of a specific EHR.

--------
SELECT c
FROM EHR e[ehr_id/value=$ehrUid] CONTAINS COMPOSITION c
--------

==== TOP

The `TOP` syntax was borrowed from SQL language for representing the number of result sets that should be returned by the AQL query. It uses `BACKWARD` and `FORWARD` to indicate the direction where to start to get the number of results to be returned.

It starts with keyword TOP, followed by an integer number and/or the direction (i.e. `BACKWARD`, `FORWARD`), e.g.

--------
SELECT
   TOP 10 c/name/value AS Name, c/context/start_time AS date_time, c/composer/name AS Composer
FROM
   EHR e[ehr_id/value=$ehrUid]
      CONTAINS COMPOSITION c
--------

==== Name alias

As in SQL, `AQL` supports the use of a name alias for the retrieved data. This is domne with the keyword `AS`, followed by the name which conforms to the syntax rule of AQL variable.

=== ORDER BY

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the returned results. The keyword `ORDER BY` is followed by an identified path and the keyword `DESC`, `DESCENDING`, `ASCE`, or `ASCENDING`, e.g.

--------
ORDER BY c/name/value
--------

=== TIMEWINDOW

In addition to the `FROM` clause, `TIMEWINDOW` helps to scope the data source from which the required data is retrieved. `TIMEWINDOW` is an addition query clause used in AQL to constrain the query to data that was available in the system (also know the data committal time) within the specified time criteria. This supports a time-based conditions to query historical versions of data, allowing a query to be executed as though it was performed at that specified time, which is essential for medico-legal reporting.

It starts with the keyword `TIMEWINDOW`, and followed by a string compatible with the ISO 8601 representation of time interval.

The first example below constrains the query source to data committed to the system before 2006-01-01.

--------
TIMEWINDOW /2006-01-01
--------

The second example constrains the query source to data committed within the period of two years before 2006-01-01.

--------
TIMEWINDOW P2Y/2006-01-01
--------

=== LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset

The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses are used to constraint the number of results from a query. With `LIMIT row_count`,
the result will have at most row_count items. And `OFFSET offset` is used to get results in a paginated way. For instance,
when offset = 0 and row_count = 10, the result will have at most 10 items, starting with item 0. Then with offset = 10 and
row_count = 10, the result will contain 10 items at most, now from item 10 to 19. So increasing `offset` by `row_count`,
allows to get all the results when needed, or just a subset. This avoids to affect database performance by having dozens,
or even millions, of records showing up in the query results, getting more items only when it's needed.

Both `row_count` and `offset` are integer numbers, `row_count` minimal value is 1, while minimal value for `offset` is 0.

If OFFSET offset is not specified, offset = 0 is assumed.
